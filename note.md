`Revision of react 18`

- What makes react is the notion of reusability, speed, virtual DOM, components
- To use react we must also install nodejs
- Everything in a react applicatoin lives in the App.js file and the code is injected in the root division of the App.js file.
- package-lock.json is a snapshot of all the dependencies in a project
- When a react project is created the first task is to remove most of the boilerplate files
- In the index.js file we import the reactDOM and react module from react and 'react-dom/client' respectively
- In the index.js file after the function we create a root function and set it to

```
    const root ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root'))
```

- main extensions for react-apps: auto rename tag; highlight matching tag; prettier
